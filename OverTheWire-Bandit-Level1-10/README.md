# OverTheWire Bandit: Levels 0â€“10 Walkthrough

## About This Repo

This repo documents my personal walkthrough of Levels 0 through 10 of the **Bandit wargame** by OverTheWire.  

Bandit is where you learn to stop being afraid of the terminal. If you're just starting out with cybersecurity, Linux or CTF-style games, this is the perfect entry point. Safe hack!

My approach here is simple:

- Explain things in plain language
- Make the commands readable
- Keep the logic understandable
- Document as I grow
